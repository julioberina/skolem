# skolem

FIXME: My attempt to solve the Skolem Problem using Clojure, a Lisp dialect that runs on the JVM.

## Overview
The Skolem problem is a problem in computer science that has been open since the 60s. It asks the
question:
> Given any linear recurrence relation (with certain initial conditions), does it contain a zero?
When I created the program, I wrote a few functions to generate a linear recurrence relation and find the zeroes in that sequence.
The two important functions of the program are:
- lrr: Generates a linear recurrence relation given certain initial conditions
- skolemization: Finds the index of a zero in a linear recurrence relation.

The format of the linear recurrence relation equation in the program is
> a_n = c_0*a_n-k + c_1*a_n-(k+1) + ... + c_(n-1)*a_0

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    Before using this program, I assume the following:
    - You have an installation of Java on your machine
    - It's location is on your PATH.
    - You have taken (or are taking) calculus
    
    To run the program:
    $ java -jar skolem-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
    
    Once the program is running, you will be asked for the following:
    - The sequence's initial terms
    - k
    - Are all coefficients 1?
    - if yes to the question, the coefficients of the equation in order
    - The number of terms you'd like to generate (n)
    
    You will then get n terms of the sequence according to the conditions you inputted.
    Below that line displays the terms in the sequence that are zero  (a_n, n = index of zero).
    Then it will prompt you to state if you would like to run the program again.
